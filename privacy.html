<b>E-Trip Protect (ETP) Online Privacy Statement</b><br>
Last Updated: February 1, 2021<br>

This statement (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to the ETP website, services, and products and applications that collect data and display these terms, owned and operated by E-Trip Protect. <br>
<br> 
At ETP, we are committed to earning your trust by respecting and protecting the privacy of the information you provide to us online. The following describes how ETP collects, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. In accessing ETP services and choosing to use ETP as your insurance service agent and/or representative you agree to accept the terms of this policy.<br>
<br>
ETP collects and uses your information as follows and for the following reasons.  ETP provides information regarding travel and health care-related health plans and acts as an agent for corporations that provide such plans. ETP may send your personal data to health plan providers for use and processing as necessary to serve you or to provide you with the best products, services and experiences possible.  ETP does not sell, or share ETP customer data with any third party for marketing or purposes other than obtaining insurance policies and servicing ETP clients.<br>
<br>
ETP collects very limited information that is needed to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. Regardless of the source, we believe it’s important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy.
In correlation with your relationship with us (e.g. consumer insured or policyholder; prospective customer; or other person relating to our business), we may collect the following personal information from you and your dependents or an insurance company from which you have obtained a policy:
&nbsp;&nbsp;•Name; gender; marital status; citizenship; date of birth; physical attributes; current or former medical condition and health status including other factors affecting insurability; relationship to the policy holder, insured, or claimant; contact information such as email, mailing, or alternate address, telephone, mobile, fax number; affiliated company or sponsoring organization; financial information such as payment card number and billing address; unique identifiers such as group, insured or member ID;
We may also collect from you or your insurance company, information about your contacts such as your beneficiaries; your medical practitioner’s name, address, and contact information; to resolve problems related to a claim. When you provide us with personal information about your contacts we will only use this information for the specific reason for which it is provided.<br>
<br>
We may receive information about you from third parties from whom we have obtained data, and combine this data with information we already have about you. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site.<br>
<br>
The ETP website does not use cookies.<br>
<br>
We may use your personal information to assist in the fulfillment of insurance products you may purchase or to assist in resolving problems related to any insurance claims that you may submit, including, but not limited to working with providers, handling appeals, and resolving complaints. <br>
<br>
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should contact ETP. If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable time frame. In certain circumstances we may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a service.
When you sign into a site or service using your ETP account, we collect certain information in order to verify your identity on behalf of the site or service, to protect you from malicious account usage, and to protect the efficiency and security of the ETP account service. <br>
<br>
Except as described in this privacy statement, we will not disclose your personal information to a third party without your prior consent and as permitted under applicable laws.
We may share your information with third parties that provide services or products that you have purchased through ETP. <br>
<br>
In certain situations, ETP may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of ETP, our insured, clients or our customers, including enforcing the terms governing your use of the services, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. <br>
<br>
We may display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our website in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact ETP.<br>
<br>
Our website(s) includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of ETP. If you submit personal information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.
<br><br>
<b>California Consumer Privacy Act</b><br>
ETP does not sell your personal data to third parties and will not do so. Any data that ETP processes on your behalf is subject to your express consent or relates to services that you have asked us to perform on your behalf.<br>
<br>
You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by contacting ETP. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time frame. In certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain your personal information or may need to retain your personal information in order to continue providing a service. If you believe you have other rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act or have other questions regarding your data, please contact ETP.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Changes to Our Privacy Statements</b><br>
We will occasionally update our privacy statements to reflect customer feedback and changes in our services. When we post changes to a statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of the statement.<br>
